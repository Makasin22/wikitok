# WikiTok Angular

This is an experimental Angular rewrite of the original React project.
It implements a minimal version of the app using Angular components and services.
Articles are fetched from [NeoLurk](https://neolurk.org) using its MediaWiki API.

To run the app you normally need the Angular CLI and dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Due to the environment restrictions in this repository the dependencies are not
installed, but the source code is provided for reference.
